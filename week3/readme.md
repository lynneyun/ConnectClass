I think I need a better 'mental model' of what my code is doing â€” I'm still spending a lot of time tweaking a piece of code, uploading it on Fetch, and then seeing what has changed.

This week, I updated my 'gratitude journal' from last week. It saves multiple entries, and you can open each entry and search them as well.

Here's a screenshot of the results:
